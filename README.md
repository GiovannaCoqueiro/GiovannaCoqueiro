## Hello everyone!! 👋

#### I'm Giovanna 💕

---

Motivated software engineering student with a background in electronics seeking a challenging position in the technology industry. Passionate about creating innovative software solutions and leveraging gaming experience to enhance user experiences. Eager to contribute technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and strong work ethic to a dynamic organization.

In addition to completing 42 Piscine, I have also studied the CS50, a Harvard course of introdution to computer science where I could understand better how things work underneath the code, and also have a first glance at Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I'm passionate about technology and always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and skills!
