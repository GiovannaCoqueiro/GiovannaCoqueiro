## Hello everyone!! 👋

#### I'm Giovanna 💕

---

I am a software engineering student with a background in electronics, and I recently completed 42 Piscine in 42 São Paulo, an intensive coding boot camp where I gained experience in C.

In addition to completing 42 Piscine, I have also studied the CS50, a Harvard course of introdution to computer science where I could understand better how things work underneath the code, and also have a first glance at Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I'm passionate about technology and always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and skills!
